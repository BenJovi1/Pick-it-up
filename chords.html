    <h2>Chord diagrams</h2>
    <p>Chord diagrams are visual representations of how to play chords on the guitar. They show you where to place your fingers on the fretboard.</p>
    <p>The numbered circles indicate which fingers to use so when says one you would use your index finger, when it says 2 you would use your middle finger,
        <br> When it says 3 you would use your ring finger and if it says 4 you would use your pinkie finger.
        <br> The x above the string means you don't play that string and the o above the string means you play that string open.
        <br>If there is a line it means that you lay down a finger across all strings, playing a barre chord (wich are very advanced).</p>

        <h2>Strumming patterns</h2>
        <p>Strumming patterns are the rhythms you use to play chords.
            <br> Often times this will be symbolized by up and down arrows.
            <br>When the arrow points up you will strum from the high e string to the low e string.
            <br>When the arrow points down you will strum from the low e string the the high e string. Songs typically end in a downstrum.</p>
